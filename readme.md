## Overview

TypeBox Workbench is a browser based compiler tool that transforms TypeScript types into TypeBox types as well as types for several other ecosystem libraries. The tool is mostly written as a prototyping and debugging utility for TypeBox, but can be used as a simple copy paste utility to quickly convert existing TS types into runtime safe types.
